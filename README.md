# THE NEOTOMA PALEOECOLOGY DATABASE: A RESEARCH-OUTREACH NEXUS

This repository is the source for a paper by the members of the Neotoma Paleoecological Database for a special issue to be released by the Palentological Society on the use of web-resources for teaching in the Earth sciences.

## Key Messages

* Neotoma is a critical resource for studies of Quaternary change, it provides a high quality curated dataset drawn from the literature, and uses domain experts to validate and maintain data quality.

* The Database also serves as a nexus for ongoing outreach, by engaging with research and user communities, and by providing the resources neccessary to broaden outreach, for example, by partnering with FlyOver Country or the Paleobiological Database.

* This model, a domian database, with broad and diverse leadership, actively engaged with the research community and outreach experts, provides a roadmap to future development within the emerging Earth science cyberinfrastructure network.
