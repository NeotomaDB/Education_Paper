![Examples of Quaternary datasets, simplified and adapted from their original publications: (1) Species migration through time beginning 11,000 years before present (11ka), here, *Picea* (spruce) in Europe after the end of the last ice age [from Latalowa and van der Knaap, -@latalowa2006late]; (2) Megafaunal extinction interpreted from the decline in the fungal spore Sporormiella, present in the dung of large herbivores [after @gill2009pleistocene] and (3) change in mammal body size in the ground squirrel *Spermophilus beecheyi* [after @blois2008environmental].](figures/three_panel_rev.png)

![*The Neotoma Explorer is a web based data discovery tool, that allows a map based search for paleoecological sites using species names, site locations, site names, or other associated metadata (a). The tool provides the opportunity to examine individual sites (b) and to select a number of sites for download and later processing or study (c).*](figures/explorer.png)

![FlyOver Country provides a platform to access and engage with Earth science data from a mobile device. FlyOver Country is connected to databases such as Neotoma though the use of Neotoma's Application Program Interface, and adds another layer of usability to the raw data resources of Neotoma.](figures/FCneo_nexus6p-portrait.png){ width=50% }

![CCDRs involved in engagement can access new communities outside of the traditional sphere of activity in the research community, here various activities allow a database to engage with community experts (data stewards), data contributors, researchers accessing data, but also educators and individuals involved in outreach activities through platforms such as Flyover Country by providing well documented workflows for accessing and understanding the data within the database.
